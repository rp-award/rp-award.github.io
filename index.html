            <p> The act of generating new hypotheses from existing data is a major component in the process of science. Dr. Albert Szent-Gy√∂rgyi has been quoted as saying "discovery consists of seeing what everybody has seen, and thinking what nobody
              has thought." Recent advances in data sharing, combined with the expectation that publicly funded research will be shared, have led to projects that consist largely of secondary analysis of data. The practitioners of this craft may
              analyze or combine these data in ways that answer scientific questions that the initial investigators did not consider. In a <strong><a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe1516564">2016 editorial</a></strong>, the New
              England Journal of Medicine termed these people "research parasites." </p>
            <p> The Parasite awards, given annually, recognize outstanding contributions to the rigorous secondary analysis of data. This practice of secondary analysis plays a key role in the scientific ecosystem: conclusions that persist through
              substantial reanalysis are expected to be more credible; and analyses that extract more knowledge from underutilized data make the practice of science more efficient. </p>

            <p> <strong>Applications for the 2025 Research Parasite Awards must be received by August 23, 2024 at 5PM HST (Hawaii Standard Time)</strong> at <strong><a href="mailto:parasite.award@gmail.com">parasite.award@gmail.com</a></strong>. The award will be
              presented via a video livestream. We plan for this to occur during the first week of January as part of the <strong><a href="http://psb.stanford.edu" target="_blank">30th Annual Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing</a></strong>. An application requires: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>An application letter describing how each selected paper meets the criteria for the award.</li>
              <li>Junior Parasite (aka the sporozoite): a PDF of one paper published after peer review on which the application will be judged.</li>
              <li>Sustained Parasitism (aka the merozoite): PDFs of three papers published after peer review on which the application will be judged.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> The award winners will be recognized at the <strong><a href="http://psb.stanford.edu">Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing</a></strong> each year and listed on the PSB website along with links to the winning papers. </p>
            <h3>Eligibility</h3>
            <p><strong>Selection criteria (both awards) for the work in question:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The awardee must not have been involved the design of the experiments that generated the data.</li>
              <li>The awardee published independently of the original investigators, and the original investigators are not authors of the secondary analyses but are appropriately credited in the manuscripts.</li>
              <li>The awardee may have extended, replicated or disproved what the original investigators had posited.</li>
              <li>The awardee has provided source code and intermediate or final results in a manner that enhances reproducibility.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Additional selection criteria for the Junior Parasite award:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The awardee must have published the work at the training stage of their career (postdoctoral, graduate, or undergraduate). If the awardee has assumed a position as an independent investigator she or he should not have been in that
                position for more than 2 years.</li>
              <li>The award will be based on work described in a single manuscript (submitted alongside the application letter).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Additional selection criteria for the Sustained Parasitism award:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The awardee must be in an independent investigator position in academia, industry or public sector.</li>
              <li>The awardee must be a last or corresponding author on the three manuscripts submitted alongside the application letter.</li>
              <li>At least a five-year period must have elapsed between the publication of the first manuscript and the final manuscript.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> By submitting an application you agree that the decisions of the parasite award committee are final, and the committee is unable to provide feedback on applications that were not selected. </p>

                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">Winner of the 2017 Junior Parasite Award.</p>
                  <p>The 2017 junior parasite award recipient was Dr. Kun-Hsing Yu. In the <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12474">research for which he was nominated</a>, Dr. Yu and colleagues employed existing datasets and software in
                    an innovative new analysis. They reanalyzed TCGA histopathology images and Stanford Tissue Microarray data and extracted features using methods built into CellProfiler. They employed a number of different machine learning
                    approaches using packages for the R programming language, which were mentioned and cited in the manuscript. They also provided source code and data for the analyses under an open license.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Yu says:
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>I would like to take this opportunity to thank the PSB Parasite Award Committee for organizing this award and my Ph.D. co-advisors Professors Michael Snyder and Russ Altman for supervising my work and nominating me for the
                      award.</p>
                    <p>Research parasitism, or secondary data analysis, plays a key role in the scientific ecosystem. With data reanalysis, we can ensure the reproducibility of scientific investigations, make the most of the underutilized data, and
                      integrate data from different sources to generate novel biomedical insights. Currently, most biomedical data is trapped in silos, which hinders scientific progress and improvement of healthcare. Biomedical informaticians
                      routinely integrate diverse data types and are in a great position to revolutionize biomedical investigations by breaking the silos, accelerating the scientific process, and translating big data into deep knowledge in
                      biomedicine.</p>
                    <p>It takes a whole ecosystem to advance science, and secondary data analysis is indispensable for biomedical investigations in the 21st century. As a biomedical informatician, I am very proud of being able to contribute to the
                      ecosystem in a revolutionary way.</p>

                  <p>The 2017 sustained parasite award recipient was Dr. Erick Turner. In the research for which he was nominated [<a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa065779#t=article">1</a>, <a

                    publication bias. According to published literature, nearly all clinical trials of antidepressants that they evaluated were positive. However at the FDA level, only half showed a significant positive effect. Dr. Turner and his
                    collaborators have continued to identify reporting biases for a sustained period.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Turner says:
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>In each of these studies, I and my colleagues have ‚Äúparasitically‚Äù compared published peer-reviewed journal articles to FDA drug approval packages. These are freely available to the public but unfortunately user-unfriendly. To
                      correct this, we have been developing OpenTrialsFDA, a project aimed at making the FDA‚Äôs trove of drug data easier to access and use. The goal is to grow the community of ‚ÄúFDA parasites‚Äù so that researchers and others, including
                      journalists, can get a much more complete and ‚Äúunspun‚Äù picture of how safe and effective our drugs really are.</p>
                    <p>OpenTrialsFDA is currently one of 6 finalists for the <a href="http://event.capconcorp.com/wp/osp/">Open Science Prize</a>.</p>

                    <p>n 2018, it‚Äôs really quite surprising that we still need to encourage people to re-analyze each other‚Äôs data and to view secondary analyses as a positive, and even essential, part of science. My work combines experimental and
                      computational approaches to study cancer genetics, and I can‚Äôt think of a single project in our lab that cannot benefit from some secondary data analysis. Simply put, there‚Äôs so much published data out there, that it just
                      doesn‚Äôt make sense not to use it routinely in our research.</p>
                    <p>Looking at existing data with fresh eyes is crucial for scientific breakthroughs. I'm proud to be recognized for that sort of achievement, and I intend to keep combining data generation, primary data analysis and secondary data
                      analysis as equally-important aspects of my research.</p>

                  <h2>Julie Dunning Hotopp</h2>
                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">Winner of the 2018 Sustained Parasitism Award.</p>
                  <p>The 2018 sustained parasite award recipient was Dr. Julie Dunning Hotopp. In the research for which she was nominated [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1142490">1</a>, <a
                      href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003107">2</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s40168-016-0224-8">3</a>], Dr. Dunning Hotopp and colleagues identified lateral gene transfer between bacteria and animals by examining
                    genome data in public repositories. A continuing theme of Dr. Dunning Hotopp's research has been that there's more to be found by delving into sequences that others have discarded. For her substantial, sustained contributions in
                    this area the committee selected her as the 2018 Sustained Parasitism recipient.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Dunning Hotopp says:
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>In these studies, my collaborators, my group, and I have used publicly available genome sequencing data to challenge paradigms, demonstrating that bacterial DNA can integrate into invertebrate animal genomes, and possibly even
                      the somatic human genome. Genome sequencing projects, from the beginning, have embraced the release of raw data to enable testing of alternate hypotheses. Our research program uses such data to demonstrate that not only does
                      bacteria-to-animal lateral gene transfer occur, but that it can be quite common. We continue to develop tools and resources to enable discover of lateral gene transfer in genome sequencing data and continue our own work on
                      bacteria-animal lateral gene transfer.</p>
